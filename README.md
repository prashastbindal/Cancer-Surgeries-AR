# Cancer-Surgeries-AR
Augmented Reality App to assist cancer surgeries

The project uses near-infrared fluorescence imaging to facilitate cancer surgeries by displaying cancer tumors in augmented reality.
It involves registering images from a fluorescence camera with Microsoft Kinectâ€™s RGB view and then locating the tumor in a 3D coordinate space using Kinect's depth map. These 3D coordinates are subsequently projected on the Google Glass and seen in augmented reality.
